Airbnb listings analysis using NumPy
# Airbnb Listings Analysis using NumPy

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings data using NumPy to understand pricing behavior, availability patterns, and numerical trends across different locations and property attributes.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Data inspection and handling of large datasets
- Conversion of data into NumPy arrays for numerical processing
- Statistical analysis on pricing, availability, and ratings
- Filtering and conditional analysis to compare different listing characteristics
- Identification of patterns and outliers in listing prices

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is large and therefore not uploaded to this repository.
Dataset source: Kaggle (Airbnb Listings Dataset)

## Key Takeaways
- Price variation depends on multiple listing attributes
- Certain locations and property types show higher average prices
- Numerical analysis helps identify meaningful trends in large datasets

## Purpose
This project was created to practice NumPy-based analysis on a real-world, large-scale dataset.
